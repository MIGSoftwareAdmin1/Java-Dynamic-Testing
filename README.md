# Java-Dynamic-Testing


# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Maximizing coverage of dynamic testing at all stages of development.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Collecting requirements and then testing against those requirements.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach by creating a minimum viable product then iterating on that with feedback and testing to create a best-in-class product with documentation along the way.
